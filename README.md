# BruteSpray_attack
login Bruteforce/Passwordspray attack 
# Project goal
A joint project with CYE, a cyber security company, aims to develop a hacking tool for password spray, credentials brute force, and an admin enumerating the login interfaces.
# Introduction
Many underestimate the power of hacking tools such as a dictionary or brute force attacks on login interfaces. Thus, they don’t implement proper defense mechanisms on their website login interfaces or emphasize that users create strong passwords. As a result, hackers use these attacks to their advantage. Our goal is to provide a pen-testing tool to help raise awareness
# Functiionality & Algorithm

1- locate the website admin’s login page.
2- scrape login page content.
3- perform login attempts on the login form.
4- rotate ip with every couple of attempts!

# About the algorithm
The user is only required to enter the websites URL and the program will automatically locate the admin’s login page based on the website’s technology and perform the attack with a given username/password lists.
